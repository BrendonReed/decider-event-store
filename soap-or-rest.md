# SOAP vs. REST

---

## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

- SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.
- It is based on XML and is highly standardized.
- SOAP typically uses HTTP, but other transport protocols such as SMTP can also be used.
- SOAP messages are rigidly structured and require a predefined contract (WSDL) for communication.

## REST (Representational State Transfer)

- REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol (usually HTTP).
- RESTful systems use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for data manipulation.
- Resources are represented as URIs and can be manipulated using a uniform interface.

## Key Differences

- **Data Format**: SOAP uses XML for message formatting, while REST commonly uses JSON or XML.
- **Flexibility**: REST offers more flexibility in terms of message format and communication protocol.
- **Statelessness**: REST is inherently stateless, while SOAP can maintain session state.
- **Complexity**: SOAP can be more complex due to its strict standards and contract-based approach, whereas REST is simpler and more lightweight.
- **Caching**: REST supports caching mechanisms, improving performance, while SOAP does not have built-in caching mechanisms.
